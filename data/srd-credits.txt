Credits Plugin
SumRndmDde

This is a plugin that adds an entirely new scene to your game for the
purpose of giving credit!

Anyway, here‚Äôs how you set things up:

========================================================================
Calling the Credits Page
========================================================================

In order to open the Credits, simply use the Plugin Command:

OpenCredits

Or, alternatively, you can use the script call:

SceneManager.push(Scene_SRD_Credits)

If you wish to bind it to the menu using Yanfly‚Äôs Main Menu Manager,
use the following bind:

this.openCredits.bind(this)

========================================================================
Creating Categories
========================================================================

In the Parameters, there are section for each category.
Categories are primarily meant to be things like:
Plugins, Music, Tilesets, etc‚Ä¶

Any category that has a name that isn‚Äôt blank will be shown in game.

========================================================================
Creating Credits
========================================================================

Underneath a category‚Äôs name is its credits.
This is simply a list of each credit you wish to give separated with
commas.

An example of this would be:

SumRndmDde, Google, The World, Dio, Butts

Each one of these will be listed in the credits window and can have
their own link and description.

========================================================================
Creating Credits File
========================================================================

To properly use this Plugin, one must also create a text file.
The text file needs to be in the data folder and called ‚Äúsrd-text.txt‚Äù.

Within this file, you need to create notetags to set up the links and
descriptions for each credit.

========================================================================
Setting a Link for a Credit
========================================================================

To set up a link for a credit, use the notetag within the file:

<[Name] Link: [Link]>

For example:

<SumRndmDde Link: http://sumrndm.site>

This would make it so clicking on a credit named ‚ÄúSumRndmDde‚Äù would open
up my site. üôÇ

========================================================================
Setting a Description for a Credit
========================================================================

To set up a description for a credit, use the notetag within the file:

<[Name] Description>

</[Name] Description>

For example:

<SumRndmDde Description>
Used some random plugins.
They were pretty cool I guess.
Only used the credit one though.
I give it a 7/10.
</SumRndmDde Description>

This would make that description appear in the description window when
the credit ‚ÄúSumRndmDde‚Äù is highlighted.

Also keep in mind that you can use text codes!
